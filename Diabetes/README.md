# DataScience_Feature-Engineering
## Description
A diabetes study was conducted among Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA. It is aimed to create a model to predict diabetes disease based on the data obtained. 
This project aims to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.For this purpose, the following steps were followed.
- Understand the structure and overall story of the data
- Detection of outliers values and solving the problem
- Detection of missing values and solving the problem
- Encoding operations
- Standardization procedures
- Establishment of the primitive model
- Visualization of feature importance
## Content
The dataset is part of a larger dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the US.  The target variable is "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative test result.
## Columns
    Pregnancies : Number of pregnancies
    Glucose : 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test
    Blood Pressure : Blood Pressure (small blood pressure) (mm Hg)
    SkinThickness : Skin Thickness
    Insulin : 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    DiabetesPedigreeFunction : A function that calculates the probability of having diabetes according to descendants
    BMI : Body mass index
    Age : Age (years)
    Outcome : Have the disease (1) or not (0)
